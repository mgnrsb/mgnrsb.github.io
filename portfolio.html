  <h2>Shift, 2014</h2>
  <p>Shift is an online donation platform that gives money directly to ultra-poor women in villages in Uganda.</p>
  <p>The consulting project involved conducting empathy interviews and ideation sessions based on Stanford's d.school design process, which resulted in a new brand name and style guide.</p>
  <p>With the new look, we created mockups that would focus on women's strength and progress, a radical change from traditional narratives about poverty that play on pity.</p>

  <h2>Commotion Wireless, 2013</h2>
  <p>Commotion Wireless is a community-focused organization that creates router software and documentation to set up mesh networks.</p>
  <p>We wanted to create a framework for user testing that would help guide decisions on the front end design. In this project, we tested the QuickStart setup wizard for beginners.</p>
  <p>We were able to create a low-cost, agile solution that involved all stakeholders in virtual observation of the users as they attempted different tasks.</p>

  <h2>SmartGirl, 2011</h2>
  <p>SmartGirl is an outreach website for middle schools inherited by the University of Michigan. Our goal was to create a fun, interesting platform for girls to engage with statistics and mathematics.</p>
  <p>We ran focus groups and surveys in order to guide the rebranding and redesign of the site. We converted the site from a tables-based layout to a flexible CSS layout, and we added interactive features such as comments. We were able to build a loyal base of volunteers who regularly contributed fresh content throughout the site.</p>
  <p>Although SmartGirl hasn't had a maintainer for several years, the site remains active to this day.</p>
